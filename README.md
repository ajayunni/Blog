# Website Development

This is a website that I'm still working on as a side project to learn  **full stack development**. I have taken help from [The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colte Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) and also from the good folks at stackoverflow to create this website from *scratch*.
